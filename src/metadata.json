Colors and blinking are customizable.\n\nIf you have questions, please take a look at the FAQ:\nhttp://goo.gl/lmwtW\n\nCredits: The idea of painting the message on user's menu was borrowed from 'Pidgin Persistent Notification' extension by nemo. The code itself has some parts forked from 'Message Notifier' extension by barisione, 'Media player indicator' extension by eon and convenience.js from git.gnome.org/gnome-shell-extensions. The blink idea and it's initial code was written by hossman. The initial gnome 3.10 support was done by Anthony25. The filtering support was done by ilgarmehmetali",
